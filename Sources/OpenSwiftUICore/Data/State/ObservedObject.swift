/// A property wrapper type that subscribes to an observable object and
/// invalidates a view whenever the observable object changes.
///
/// Add the `@ObservedObject` attribute to a parameter of an OpenSwiftUI ``View``
/// when the input is an
/// [ObservableObject](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/combine/observableobject)
/// and you want the view to update when the object's published properties
/// change. You typically do this to pass a ``StateObject`` into a subview.
///
/// The following example defines a data model as an observable object,
/// instantiates the model in a view as a state object, and then passes
/// the instance to a subview as an observed object:
///
///     class DataModel: ObservableObject {
///         @Published var name = "Some Name"
///         @Published var isEnabled = false
///     }
///
///     struct MyView: View {
///         @StateObject private var model = DataModel()
///
///         var body: some View {
///             Text(model.name)
///             MySubView(model: model)
///         }
///     }
///
///     struct MySubView: View {
///         @ObservedObject var model: DataModel
///
///         var body: some View {
///             Toggle("Enabled", isOn: $model.isEnabled)
///         }
///     }
///
/// When any published property of the observable object changes, OpenSwiftUI
/// updates any view that depends on the object. Subviews can
/// also make updates to the model properties, like the ``Toggle`` in the
/// above example, that propagate to other observers throughout the view
/// hierarchy.
///
/// Don't specify a default or initial value for the observed object. Use the
/// attribute only for a property that acts as an input for a view, as in the
/// above example.
///
/// > Note: Don't wrap objects conforming to the
/// [Observable](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/Observation/Observable)
/// protocol with `@ObservedObject`. OpenSwiftUI automatically tracks dependencies
/// to `Observable` objects used within body and updates dependent views when
/// their data changes. Attempting to wrap an `Observable` object with
/// `@ObservedObject` may cause a compiler error, because it requires that its
/// wrapped object to conform to the
/// [ObservableObject](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/combine/observableobject)
/// protocol.
/// >
/// > If the view needs a binding to a property of an `Observable` object in
/// its body, wrap the object with the ``Bindable`` property wrapper instead;
/// for example, `@Bindable var model: DataModel`. For more information, see
/// <doc:Managing-model-data-in-your-app>.
