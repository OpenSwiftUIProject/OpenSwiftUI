/// A property wrapper type that can read and write a value owned by a source of
/// truth.
///
/// Use a binding to create a two-way connection between a property that stores
/// data, and a view that displays and changes the data. A binding connects a
/// property to a source of truth stored elsewhere, instead of storing data
/// directly. For example, a button that toggles between play and pause can
/// create a binding to a property of its parent view using the `Binding`
/// property wrapper.
///
///     struct PlayButton: View {
///         @Binding var isPlaying: Bool
///
///         var body: some View {
///             Button(isPlaying ? "Pause" : "Play") {
///                 isPlaying.toggle()
///             }
///         }
///     }
///
/// The parent view declares a property to hold the playing state, using the
/// ``State`` property wrapper to indicate that this property is the value's
/// source of truth.
///
///     struct PlayerView: View {
///         var episode: Episode
///         @State private var isPlaying: Bool = false
///
///         var body: some View {
///             VStack {
///                 Text(episode.title)
///                     .foregroundStyle(isPlaying ? .primary : .secondary)
///                 PlayButton(isPlaying: $isPlaying) // Pass a binding.
///             }
///         }
///     }
///
/// When `PlayerView` initializes `PlayButton`, it passes a binding of its state
/// property into the button's binding property. Applying the `$` prefix to a
/// property wrapped value returns its ``State/projectedValue``, which for a
/// state property wrapper returns a binding to the value.
///
/// Whenever the user taps the `PlayButton`, the `PlayerView` updates its
/// `isPlaying` state.
///
/// A binding conforms to ``Sendable`` only if its wrapped value type also
/// conforms to ``Sendable``. It is always safe to pass a sendable binding
/// between different concurrency domains. However, reading from or writing
/// to a binding's wrapped value from a different concurrency domain may or
/// may not be safe, depending on how the binding was created. OpenSwiftUI will
/// issue a warning at runtime if it detects a binding being used in a way
/// that may compromise data safety.
///
/// > Note: To create bindings to properties of a type that conforms to the
/// [Observable](https://swiftpackageindex.com/openswiftuiproject/openobservation/main/documentation/openobservation/observable)
/// protocol, use the ``Bindable`` property wrapper. For more information,
/// see <doc:Migrating-from-the-observable-object-protocol-to-the-observable-macro>.
