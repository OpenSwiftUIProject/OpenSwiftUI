// MARK: - Transition

/// A description of view changes to apply when a view is added to and removed
/// from the view hierarchy.
///
/// A transition should generally be made by applying one or more modifiers to
/// the `content`. For symmetric transitions, the `isIdentity` property on
/// `phase` can be used to change the properties of modifiers. For asymmetric
/// transitions, the phase itself can be used to change those properties.
/// Transitions should not use any identity-affecting changes like `.id`, `if`,
/// and `switch` on the `content`, since doing so would reset the state of the
/// view they're applied to, causing wasted work and potentially surprising
/// behavior when it appears and disappears.
///
/// The following code defines a transition that can be used to change the
/// opacity and rotation when a view appears and disappears.
///
///     struct RotatingFadeTransition: Transition {
///         func body(content: Content, phase: TransitionPhase) -> some View {
///             content
///               .opacity(phase.isIdentity ? 1.0 : 0.0)
///               .rotationEffect(phase.rotation)
///         }
///     }
///     extension TransitionPhase {
///         fileprivate var rotation: Angle {
///             switch self {
///             case .willAppear: return .degrees(30)
///             case .identity: return .zero
///             case .didDisappear: return .degrees(-30)
