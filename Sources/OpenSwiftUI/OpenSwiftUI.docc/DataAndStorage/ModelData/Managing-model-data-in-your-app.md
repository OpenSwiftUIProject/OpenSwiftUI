# Managing model data in your app

Create connections between your app’s data model and views.

## Overview

An OpenSwiftUI app can display data that people can change using the app’s user
interface (UI). To manage that data, an app creates a data model, which is a
custom type that represents the data. A data model provides separation between
the data and the views that interact with the data. This separation promotes
modularity, improves testability, and helps make it easier to reason about how
the app works.

Keeping the model data (that is, an instance of a data model) in sync with what
appears on the screen can be challenging, especially when the data appears in
multiple views of the UI at the same time.

OpenSwiftUI helps keep your app’s UI up to date with changes made to the data
thanks to Observation. With Observation, a view in OpenSwiftUI can form
dependencies on observable data models and update the UI when data changes.

> Note:
> [Observation](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/observation) support
> in OpenSwiftUI is available starting with iOS 17, iPadOS 17, macOS 14,
> tvOS 17, and watchOS 10. For information about adopting Observation in
> existing apps, see
> [Migrating from the Observable Object protocol to the Observable macro](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swiftui/migrating-from-the-observable-object-protocol-to-the-observable-macro).

### Make model data observable

To make data changes visible to OpenSwiftUI, apply the
[Observable()](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/observation/observable())
macro to your data model. This macro generates code that adds observation
support to your data model at compile time, keeping your data model code focused
on the properties that store data. For example, the following code defines a
data model for books:

```swift
@Observable class Book: Identifiable {
    var title = "Sample Book Title"
    var author = Author()
    var isAvailable = true
}
```

Observation also supports reference and value types. To help you decide which
type to use for your data model, see
[Choosing Between Structures and Classes](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swift/choosing-between-structures-and-classes).

> Important:
> The [Observable()](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/observation/observable())
> macro, in addition to adding observation functionality, also conforms your
> data model type to the
> [Observable](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/observation/observable)
> protocol, which serves as a signal to other APIs that your type supports
> observation. Don’t apply the `Observable` protocol by itself to your data
> model type, since that alone doesn’t add any observation functionality.
> Instead, always use the `Observable` macro when adding observation support to
> your type.

### Observe model data in a view

In OpenSwiftUI, a view forms a dependency on an observable data model object,
such as an instance of Book, when the view’s ``View/body-swift.property``
property reads a property of the object. If body doesn’t read any properties of
an observable data model object, the view doesn’t track any dependencies.

When a tracked property changes, OpenSwiftUI updates the view. If other
properties change that ``View/body-swift.property`` doesn’t read, the view is
unaffected and avoids unnecessary updates. For example, the view in the
following code updates only when a book’s `title` changes but not when `author`
or `isAvailable` changes:

```swift
struct BookView: View {
    var book: Book
    
    var body: some View {
        Text(book.title)
    }
}
```

OpenSwiftUI establishes this dependency tracking even if the view doesn’t store
the observable type, such as when using a global property or singleton:

```swift
var globalBook: Book = Book()

struct BookView: View {
    var body: some View {
        Text(globalBook.title)
    }
}
```

Observation also supports tracking of computed properties when the computed
property makes use of an observable property. For instance, the view in the
following code updates when the number of available books changes:

```swift
@Observable class Library {
    var books: [Book] = [Book(), Book(), Book()]
    
    var availableBooksCount: Int {
        books.filter(\.isAvailable).count
    }
}

struct LibraryView: View {
    @Environment(Library.self) private var library
    
    var body: some View {
        NavigationStack {
            List(library.books) { book in
                // ...
            }
            .navigationTitle("Books available: \(library.availableBooksCount)")
        }
    }
}
```

When a view forms a dependency on a collection of objects, of any collection
type, the view tracks changes made to the collection itself. For instance, the
view in the following code forms a dependency on books because body reads it.
As changes occur to books, such as inserting, deleting, moving, or replacing
items in the collection, OpenSwiftUI updates the view.

```swift
struct LibraryView: View {
    @State private var books = [Book(), Book(), Book()]

    var body: some View {
        List(books) { book in 
            Text(book.title)
        }
    }
}
```

However, `LibraryView` doesn’t form a dependency on the property `title` because
the view’s ``View/body-swift.property`` doesn’t read it directly. The view
stores the ``List`` content closure as an `@escaping` closure that OpenSwiftUI
calls when lazily creating list items before they appear on the screen. This
means that instead of `LibraryView` depending on a book’s `title`, each ``Text``
item of the list depends on `title`. Any changes to a `title` updates only the
individual ``Text`` representing the book and not the others.

> Note:
> Observation tracks changes to any observable property that appears in the
> execution scope of a view’s ``View/body-swift.property`` property.

You can also share an observable model data object with another view. The
receiving view forms a dependency if it reads any properties of the object in
the its ``View/body-swift.property``. For example, in the following code
`LibraryView` shares an instance of `Book` with `BookView`, and `BookView`
displays the book’s `title`. If the book’s `title` changes, OpenSwiftUI updates
only `BookView`, and not `LibraryView`, because only `BookView` reads the title
property.

```swift
struct LibraryView: View {
    @State private var books = [Book(), Book(), Book()]

    var body: some View {
        List(books) { book in 
            BookView(book: book)
        }
    }
}

struct BookView: View {
    var book: Book
    
    var body: some View {
        Text(book.title)
    }
}
```

If a view doesn’t have any dependencies, OpenSwiftUI doesn’t update the view
when data changes. This approach allows an observable model data object to pass
through multiple layers of a view hierarchy without each intermediate view
forming a dependency.

```swift
// Will not update when any property of `book` changes.
struct LibraryView: View {
    @State private var books = [Book(), Book(), Book()]
    
    var body: some View {
        LibraryItemView(book: book)
    }
}

// Will not update when any property of `book` changes.
struct LibraryItemView: View {
    var book: Book
    
    var body: some View {
        BookView(book: book)
    }
}

// Will update when `book.title` changes.
struct BookView: View {
    var book: Book
    
    var body: some View {
        Text(book.title)
    }
}
```

However, a view that stores a reference to the observable object updates if the
reference changes. This happens because the stored reference is part of the
view’s value and not because the object is observable. For example, if the
reference to book in the follow code changes, OpenSwiftUI updates the view:

```swift
struct BookView: View {
    var book: Book
    
    var body: some View {
        // ...
    }
}
```

A view can also form a dependency on an observable data model object accessed
through another object. For example, the view in the following code updates when
the author’s `name` changes:

```swift
struct LibraryItemView: View {
    var book: Book
    
    var body: some View {
        VStack(alignment: .leading) {
            Text(book.title)
            Text("Written by: \(book.author.name)")
                .font(.caption)
        }
    }
}
```

### Create the source of truth for model data

To create and store the source of truth for model data, declare a private
variable and initialize it with a instance of an observable data model type.
Then wrap it with a ``State`` property wrapper. For example, the following code
stores an instance of the data model type Book in the state variable `book`:

```swift
struct BookView: View {
    @State private var book = Book()
    
    var body: some View {
        Text(book.title)
    }
}
```

By wrapping the book with ``State``, you’re telling OpenSwiftUI to manage the
storage of the instance. Each time OpenSwiftUI re-creates `BookView`, it
connects the `book` variable to the managed instance, providing the view a
single source of truth for the model data.

You can also create a state object in your top-level ``App`` instance or in one
of your app’s ``Scene`` instances. For example, the following code creates an
instance of `Library` in the app’s top-level structure:

```swift
@main
struct BookReaderApp: App {
    @State private var library = Library()
    
    var body: some Scene {
        WindowGroup {
            LibraryView()
                .environment(library)
        }
    }
}
```

### Share model data throughout a view hierarchy

If you have a data model object, like `Library`, that you want to share
throughout your app, you can either:

- pass the data model object to each view in the view hierarchy; or

- add the data model object to the view’s environment

Passing model data to each view is convenient when you have a shallow view
hierarchy; for example, when a view doesn’t share the object with its subviews.
However, you usually don’t know if a view needs to pass the object to subviews,
and you may not know if a subview deep inside the layers of the hierarchy needs
the model data.

To share model data throughout a view hierarchy without needing to pass it to
each view, add the model data to the view’s environment. You can add the data to
the environment using either ``environment(_:_:)`` or the ``environment(_:)``
modifier, passing in the model data.

Before you can use the ``environment(_:_:)`` modifier, you need to create a
custom ``EnvironmentKey``. Then extend ``EnvironmentValues`` to include a custom
environment property that gets and sets the value for the custom key. For
instance, the following code creates an environment key and property for
`library`:

```swift
extension EnvironmentValues {
    var library: Library {
        get { self[LibraryKey.self] }
        set { self[LibraryKey.self] = newValue }
    }
}

private struct LibraryKey: EnvironmentKey {
    static var defaultValue: Library = Library()
}
```

With the custom environment key and property in place, a view can add model data
to its environment. For example, `LibraryView` adds the source of truth for a
`Library` instance to its environment using the ``environment(_:_:)`` modifier:

```swift
@main
struct BookReaderApp: App {
    @State private var library = Library()
    
    var body: some Scene {
        WindowGroup {
            LibraryView()
                .environment(\.library, library)
        }
    }
}
```

To retrieve the `Library` instance from the environment, a view defines a local
variable that stores a reference to the instance, and then wraps the variable
with the ``Environment`` property wrapper, passing in the key path to the custom
environment value.

```swift
struct LibraryView: View {
    @Environment(\.library) private var library

    var body: some View {
        // ...
    }
}
```

You can also store model data directly in the environment without defining a
custom environment value by using the ``environment(_:)`` modifier. For
instance, the following code adds a `Library` instance to the environment using
this modifier:

```swift
@main
struct BookReaderApp: App {
    @State private var library = Library()
    
    var body: some Scene {
        WindowGroup {
            LibraryView()
                .environment(library)
        }
    }
}
```

To retrieve the instance from the environment, another view defines a local
variable to store the instance and wraps it with the ``Environment`` property
wrapper. But instead of providing a key path to the environment value, you can
provide the model data type, as shown in the following code:

```swift
struct LibraryView: View {
    @Environment(Library.self) private var library
    
    var body: some View {
        // ...
    }
}
```

By default, reading an object from the environment returns a non-optional object
when using the object type as the key. This default behavior assumes that a view
in the current hierarchy previously stored a non-optional instance of the type
using the ``environment(_:)`` modifier. If a view attempts to retrieve an object
using its type and that object isn’t in the environment, OpenSwiftUI throws
exception.

In cases where there is no guarantee that an object is in the environment,
retrieve an optional version of the object as shown in the following code. If
the object isn’t available the environment, OpenSwiftUI returns nil instead of
throwing an exception.

```swift
@Environment(Library.self) private var library: Library?
```

### Change model data in a view

In most apps, people can change data that the app presents. When data changes,
any views that display the data should update to reflect the changed data. With
Observation in OpenSwiftUI, a view can support data changes without using
property wrappers or bindings. For example, the following toggles the
`isAvailable` property of a book in the action closure of a button:

```swift
struct BookView: View {
    var book: Book
    
    var body: some View {
        List {
            Text(book.title)
            HStack {
                Text(book.isAvailable ? "Available for checkout" : "Waiting for return")
                Spacer()
                Button(book.isAvailable ? "Check out" : "Return") {
                    book.isAvailable.toggle()
                }
            }
        }
    }
}
```

However, there may be times when a view expects a binding before it can change
the value of a mutable property. To provide a binding, wrap the model data with
the ``Bindable`` property wrapper. For example, the following code wraps the
book variable with `@Bindable`. Then it uses a ``TextField`` to change the
`title` property of a book, and a ``Toggle`` to change the `isAvailable`
property, using the `$` syntax to pass a binding to each property.

```swift
struct BookEditView: View {
    @Bindable var book: Book
    @Environment(\.dismiss) private var dismiss
    
    var body: some View {
        VStack() {
            HStack {
                Text("Title")
                TextField("Title", text: $book.title)
                    .textFieldStyle(.roundedBorder)
                    .onSubmit {
                        dismiss()
                    }
            }
            
            Toggle(isOn: $book.isAvailable) {
                Text("Book is available")
            }
            
            Button("Close") {
                dismiss()
            }
            .buttonStyle(.borderedProminent)
        }
        .padding()
    }
}
```

You can use the ``Bindable`` property wrapper on properties and variables to an
[Observable](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/observation/observable)
object. This includes global variables, properties that exists outside of
OpenSwiftUI types, or even local variables. For example, you can create a
`@Bindable` variable within a view’s ``View/body-swift.property``:

```swift
struct LibraryView: View {
    @State private var books = [Book(), Book(), Book()]

    var body: some View {
        List(books) { book in 
            @Bindable var book = book
            TextField("Title", text: $book.title)
        }
    }
}
```

The `@Bindable` variable `book` provides a binding that connects ``TextField``
to the `title` property of a book so that a person can make changes directly to
the model data.
