/// A type that represents the structure and behavior of an app.
///
/// Create an app by declaring a structure that conforms to the `App` protocol.
/// Implement the required ``OpenSwiftUI/App/body-swift.property`` computed property
/// to define the app's content:
///
///     @main
///     struct MyApp: App {
///         var body: some Scene {
///             WindowGroup {
///                 Text("Hello, world!")
///             }
///         }
///     }
///
/// Precede the structure's declaration with the
/// [@main](https://docs.swift.org/swift-book/ReferenceManual/Attributes.html#ID626)
/// attribute to indicate that your custom `App` protocol conformer provides the
/// entry point into your app. The protocol provides a default implementation of
/// the ``OpenSwiftUI/App/main()`` method that the system calls to launch your app.
/// You can have exactly one entry point among all of your app's files.
///
/// Compose the app's body from instances that conform to the ``OpenSwiftUI/Scene``
/// protocol. Each scene contains the root view of a view hierarchy and has a
/// life cycle managed by the system. OpenSwiftUI provides some concrete scene types
/// to handle common scenarios, like for displaying documents or settings. You
/// can also create custom scenes.
///
///     @main
///     struct Mail: App {
///         var body: some Scene {
///             WindowGroup {
///                 MailViewer()
///             }
///             Settings {
///                 SettingsView()
///             }
///         }
///     }
///
/// You can declare state in your app to share across all of its scenes. For
/// example, you can use the ``OpenSwiftUI/StateObject`` attribute to initialize a
/// data model, and then provide that model on a view input as an
/// ``OpenSwiftUI/ObservedObject`` or through the environment as an
/// ``OpenSwiftUI/EnvironmentObject`` to scenes in the app:
///
///     @main
///     struct Mail: App {
///         @StateObject private var model = MailModel()
///
///         var body: some Scene {
///             WindowGroup {
///                 MailViewer()
///                     .environmentObject(model) // Passed through the environment.
///             }
///             Settings {
///                 SettingsView(model: model) // Passed as an observed object.
///             }
///         }
///     }

    /// with a single scene containing a single view:
    ///
    ///     @main
    ///     struct MyApp: App {
    ///         var body: some Scene {
    ///             WindowGroup {
    ///                 Text("Hello, world!")
    ///             }
    ///         }
    ///     }
    ///
    /// Swift infers the app's ``OpenSwiftUI/App/Body-swift.associatedtype``
    /// associated type based on the scene provided by the `body` property.
