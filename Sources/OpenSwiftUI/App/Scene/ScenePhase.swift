/// An indication of a scene's operational state.
///
/// The system moves your app's ``Scene`` instances through phases that reflect
/// a scene's operational state. You can trigger actions when the phase changes.
/// Read the current phase by observing the ``EnvironmentValues/scenePhase``
/// value in the ``Environment``:
///
///     @Environment(\.scenePhase) private var scenePhase
///
/// How you interpret the value depends on where it's read from.
/// If you read the phase from inside a ``View`` instance, you obtain a value
/// that reflects the phase of the scene that contains the view. The following
/// example uses the ``View/onChange(of:initial:_:)-8wgw9`` method to enable
/// a timer whenever the enclosing scene enters the ``ScenePhase/active`` phase
/// and disable the timer when entering any other phase:
///
///     struct MyView: View {
///         @ObservedObject var model: DataModel
///         @Environment(\.scenePhase) private var scenePhase
///
///         var body: some View {
///             TimerView()
///                 .onChange(of: scenePhase) {
///                     model.isTimerRunning = (scenePhase == .active)
///                 }
///         }
///     }
///
/// If you read the phase from within an ``App`` instance, you obtain an
/// aggregate value that reflects the phases of all the scenes in your app. The
/// app reports a value of ``ScenePhase/active`` if any scene is active, or a
/// value of ``ScenePhase/inactive`` when no scenes are active. This includes
/// multiple scene instances created from a single scene declaration; for
/// example, from a ``WindowGroup``. When an app enters the
/// ``ScenePhase/background`` phase, expect the app to terminate soon after.
/// You can use that opportunity to free any resources:
///
///     @main
///     struct MyApp: App {
///         @Environment(\.scenePhase) private var scenePhase
///
///         var body: some Scene {
///             WindowGroup {
///                 MyRootView()
///             }
///             .onChange(of: scenePhase) {
///                 if scenePhase == .background {
///                     // Perform cleanup when all scenes within
///                     // MyApp go to the background.
///                 }
///             }
///         }
///     }

    /// immediately upon entering this state. For example, close any open files
