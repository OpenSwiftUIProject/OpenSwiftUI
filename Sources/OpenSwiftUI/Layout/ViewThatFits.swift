public import OpenSwiftUICore

/// A view that adapts to the available space by providing the first
/// child view that fits.
///
/// `ViewThatFits` evaluates its child views in the order you provide them
/// to the initializer. It selects the first child whose ideal size on the
/// constrained axes fits within the proposed size. This means that you
/// provide views in order of preference. Usually this order is largest to
/// smallest, but since a view might fit along one constrained axis but not the
/// other, this isn't always the case. By default, `ViewThatFits` constrains
/// in both the horizontal and vertical axes.
///
/// The following example shows an `UploadProgressView` that uses `ViewThatFits`
/// to display the upload progress in one of three ways. In order, it attempts
/// to display:
///
/// * An ``HStack`` that contains a ``Text`` view and a ``ProgressView``.
/// * Only the `ProgressView`.
/// * Only the `Text` view.
///
/// The progress views are fixed to a 100-point width.
///
///     struct UploadProgressView: View {
///         var uploadProgress: Double
///
///         var body: some View {
///             ViewThatFits(in: .horizontal) {
///                 HStack {
///                     Text("\(uploadProgress.formatted(.percent))")
///                     ProgressView(value: uploadProgress)
///                         .frame(width: 100)
///                 }
///                 ProgressView(value: uploadProgress)
///                     .frame(width: 100)
///                 Text("\(uploadProgress.formatted(.percent))")
///             }
///         }
///     }
///
/// This use of `ViewThatFits` evaluates sizes only on the horizontal axis. The
/// following code fits the `UploadProgressView` to several fixed widths:
///
///     VStack {
///         UploadProgressView(uploadProgress: 0.75)
///             .frame(maxWidth: 200)
///         UploadProgressView(uploadProgress: 0.75)
///             .frame(maxWidth: 100)
///         UploadProgressView(uploadProgress: 0.75)
///             .frame(maxWidth: 50)
///     }
///
/// ![A vertical stack showing three expressions of progress, constrained by
/// the available horizontal space. The first line shows the text, 75%, and a
/// three-quarters-full progress bar. The second line shows only the progress
/// view. The third line shows only the text.](ViewThatFits-1)
