OpenSwiftUI is an open source implementation of Apple's [SwiftUI](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swiftui)

The project is for the following purposes:
- Build GUI app on non-Apple platform (eg. Linux & Windows)
- Diagnose and debug SwfitUI issues on Apple platform

And the API design is to stay the same as the original SwiftUI API as possible.

Currently, this project is in early development.
